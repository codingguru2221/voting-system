# Voting Machine Project

This project implements a simple voting machine using Python. It allows users to sign up, authenticate, cast votes, and display results. The project ensures that only registered voters can vote and that each voter can vote only once.

## Features

- **Signup System**: Users can sign up with their name, age, and legal ID proof. The system ensures that only users aged 18 or above can register. Each registered user is assigned a unique voter ID.
- **Legal ID Proofs**: Predefined legal ID proofs (Aadhar, Passport, Driving License, Voter ID) are used for registration.
- **Voting System**: Registered voters can cast their vote for predefined candidates. The system ensures that each voter can vote only once.
- **Result Display**: The results of the voting are displayed, showing the number of votes each candidate received.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- JSON module (included in the Python standard library)

## Project Structure

- `candidates`: A list of candidates available for voting.
- `votes`: A dictionary to store the number of votes each candidate has received.
- `voted_ids`: A list to track the IDs of voters who have already voted.
- `voted_names`: A list to track the names of voters who have already voted.
- `legal_id_proofs`: A list of predefined legal ID proofs.
- `voters.json`: A JSON file to store registered voter data.

## Functions

### 1. `generate_voter_id()`
Generates a unique 8-digit voter ID starting with "CE".

### 2. `signup()`
Prompts the user to enter their name, age, and legal ID proof. Registers the user if they meet the age requirement (18 or above) and assigns them a unique voter ID. Saves the registered voter data to `voters.json`.

### 3. `load_voters()`
Loads registered voter data from `voters.json`.

### 4. `cast_vote()`
Prompts the user to enter their voter ID and choose a candidate. Ensures that the voter has not voted before and that the voter is registered. Casts the vote and updates the vote count.

### 5. `display_results()`
Displays the voting results, showing the number of votes each candidate received.

## Usage

1. **Signup**: Run the `signup()` function to register a voter. The voter must provide their name, age, and legal ID proof. The system will generate and display a unique voter ID for the registered voter.
2. **Vote**: Run the `cast_vote()` function to cast a vote. The voter must enter their voter ID and choose a candidate from the list.
3. **Display Results**: Run the `display_results()` function to display the voting results.

## Example

```python
# Example usage
signup()  # Register a voter
cast_vote()  # Cast a vote
display_results()  # Display the voting results
```

## Running the Project

1. Save the code in a Python file (e.g., `voting_machine.py`).
2. Run the Python file in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to sign up, cast votes, and display results.

```bash
python voting_machine.py
```
